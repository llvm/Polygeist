# Exhaustive ATen CUDA-library audit

This audit adjudicates every provenance-linked standalone ATen C fixture against public NVIDIA libraries. It separately records whether the current rewrite covers the complete function or only an initialization/copy stage. The machine-readable CSV is the authoritative per-kernel list.

- Fixtures reviewed: 598
- Complete current rewrite candidates: 271
- Partial stage-only current matches: 85
- No current launch: 242
- Complete rewrites using genuine library/runtime algorithms: 271
- Complete generated/custom GPU fallbacks (not library matches): 0

## What exists in NVIDIA libraries

- One fixed public call: 94
- One configurable generic primitive: 83
- Complete multi-node library graph/composition: 172
- Only some stages have library primitives: 179
- No direct tensor-library implementation: 70

A named CUB algorithm means NVIDIA ships the substantive generic algorithm. Compiler-authored GPU functors are excluded from library-reuse coverage. A cuDNN graph result requires graph construction/lowering but executes vendor graph operations. None should be described as merely a missing Egglog pattern.

## Current implementation provenance

- `CUDA_RUNTIME_PRIMITIVE`: 77
- `DIRECT_VENDOR_API`: 244
- `LIBRARY_API_COMPOSITION`: 13
- `NO_IMPLEMENTATION`: 242
- `STANDARD_LIBRARY_ALGORITHM`: 22

## Compiler diagnosis

- `ALREADY_FOUND`: 271
- `BACKEND_AND_MATCHER_GAP`: 37
- `COMPOSITION_REQUIRED_NOT_MATCHER_ONLY`: 62
- `NO_LIBRARY_MATCH_EXPECTED`: 50
- `PARTIAL_MATCH_ONLY_RESIDUAL_IR_REMAINS`: 85
- `RAISING_BLOCKS_WHOLE_OP_RECOGNITION`: 93

Only the `MATCHER_COVERAGE_GAP` rows are clean, whole-operation cases for which a selected runtime-wrapper family is already present locally. The remaining positive library candidates need raising work, a new API backend, graph composition, or some combination.

## Candidate-library census

- cuDNN: 199
- CUB: 111
- none: 70
- NPP: 46
- cuBLAS: 34
- cuSPARSE: 31
- cuRAND: 27
- cuDNN Resample: 25
- CUDA Runtime: 24
- cuTENSOR: 22
- cuSOLVER: 3
- cuTensorNet: 2
- cuDNN CTC: 2
- CUTLASS: 2

## Per-kernel results

See [`cuda_library_audit.csv`](cuda_library_audit.csv). Every row includes the source provenance, current matcher scope, semantic family, candidate library/API, whole/partial availability, evidence URL, local backend status, and the precise compiler gap. The same fields are rendered on the paginated ATen Compiler Explorer pages.
